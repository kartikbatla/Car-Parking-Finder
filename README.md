# Smart Parking Space Finder

An academic project built as part of the Software Engineering course at VIT Vellore. This system detects empty parking slots in a lot using image processing techniques (OpenCV), while following a complete software engineering lifecycle—from requirements gathering to software testing.

## Project Overview

The **Smart Parking Space Finder** uses a static image or live feed to identify and highlight empty parking spaces. Built using Python and OpenCV, the goal is to assist drivers or automated systems in identifying available slots quickly and efficiently.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS ,JS
- **Backend:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy

---

## Features

- Detects empty parking slots from images or video feed
- Highlights available and unavailable parking spots
- Easy to extend for real-time camera feed
- Modular Python code with clear separation of concerns
